# tones / samples

Originally a Haxe port of https://github.com/bit101/tones for quickly making sounds with the Web Audio APIs

I've tried to keep the simplicity of the original API, with some added extras.

There's a [branch](https://github.com/mikedotalmond/tones/tree/examples) with some basic examples to get you started, and you can see them running [here](https://mikedotalmond.github.io/tones/).
